Sphinx "taglist" extension.

TagList
=======

Taglist is an extension to Sphinx documentation system.

.. note:: 

    The project it is a totally copy of sphinxcontrib-requirements with
    some modifications

Installation
------------

Instalation through pip: ::

    pip install sphinxcontrib-taglist

or through github: ::

    git clone https://github.com/spinus/sphinxcontrib-taglist
    cd sphinxcontrib-taglist
    python setup.py install

Next, you have to add extension to 'conf.py' in your sphinx project. ::

    extensions = [
              ...,
              'sphinxcontrib.taglist',  
              ...]


Configuration
-------------

When using `tags` with this extension you may want give each tag other color.
You can do that in 'conf.py' by adding: ::

    taglist_tags = {
        'tag1': {'background-color': 'green'}
    }


Directives
----------

tag:
    tag directive add a 'piece' of information, and you can tag it.

    You can use it like: ::

        .. tag:: Some tagged information
            :tag: tag1 tag2 tag3 

    or: ::

        .. tag:: [tag1 tag2 tag3] Some tagged information

    .. warning:: 

        Second method is used only if first method is not.

    .. warning:: 

        I am not sure this syntax, it may change. 
        If you have anny suggestions please let me know.

taglist:
    taglist is a directive which `catch` tags and do a list.

    Firstly it prints 'Tags: ...' with information which tags it displays, and 
    than it shows the list.

    You can use it like: ::
        
        .. taglist::
            :tags: tag1 tag3

How it works?
-------------

The codebase is derived from `sphinxcontrib-requirements` so it works in similar
way.

During document reading `tag` directives create `tag_node`s.
`taglist` create `taglist` nodes.

During resolving `taglist` nodes are changed to a piece of text `Tags:` with
tags items which will be displayed on that list.
Next it prints all tagged items.


CSS
~~~

taglist.css:
    It contains base class for tag - taglist_tag

    .. warning:: 

        It probably will be changed and put in `taglist_tags.css`.
        (And it will be configurable from `conf.py`)

Additionally, it creates the file `taglist_tags.css` during processing (with
css for each tag you defined in `conf.py`; `taglist_tags` maps all tag keys to
css keys) and write it to build directory to static files.
